### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Khoa Nguyen, you can call me Kaynor. I'm currently a senior @[Paul G. Allen School at UW](https://www.cs.washington.edu/), Research Assistant @[Makeability Lab](https://makeabilitylab.cs.washington.edu/).
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [SoundWatch](https://github.com/makeabilitylab/SoundWatch). A very cool and helpful app that provideds push notifications for critical sounds around you, like Siren, baby crying, or dog barking. 
  - It's designed for the deaf and hard of hearing community. 
  - What's more? It's the only Sound Recognition app that actually works on WearOS smartwatch, so you can listen to important sounds and get feedback at anywhere you go!
  - You might find it similar to the newly announced feature by [Google](https://blog.google/products/android/new-sound-notifications-on-android/). But we did it more accurately :)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Computer Graphics and Android Development.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Mobile Development, IOTs, and Machine Learning.
