### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Khoa Nguyen, you can call me Kaynor.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [SoundWatch](https://github.com/makeabilitylab/SoundWatch). A very cool and helpful app that provideds push notifications for critical sounds around you, like Siren, baby crying, or dog barking. 
- It's designed for the deaf and hard of hearing community. 
- What's more? It's the only Sound Recognition app that actually works on WearOS smartwatch, so you can listen to important sounds and get feedback at anywhere you go!
- You might find it similar to the newly announced feature by [Google](https://blog.google/products/android/new-sound-notifications-on-android/). Just to let you know, they "borrowed" our idea, our interface, the type of sounds we recognize, and even the name of those sounds :)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Computer Graphics and Android Development.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Mobile Development, IOTs, and Machine Learning.
